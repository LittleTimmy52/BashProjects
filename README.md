# BashProjects
Any random bash projects I make I will put here

## GameSelect
Since most of the random bash projects I will make are games, I have a simple game selector

## GuessingNum
### Purpose
This is a simple game in which the player selects a difficulty and tries to guess a number

### Additonal info
This was made with the help of ChatGPT, The guessing part and menues were easy, but I could not for the life of me get the leaderboard how I want, so
chatGPT and I worked together to get that part, and even then I still have the suspicion that it is not 100% correct, but anyways that is all.

## Testing
### Purpose
It is self explanitory, it is for testing

## WordJumble
### Purpose
Words will be jumbled and difficulty determines what words one sees

### Additonal info
This has barley started, there is nothing much here.

## sus
### Purpose
With using i3wm as my ubuntu desktop env, I got tired of having to do systemctl suspend, so I made a command that is to go into where ever you keep
custom commands like in .local/bin for instance which basically make the computer sleep in x seconds.

### Additonal info
Usage: sus (time in seconds) or -h or --help to see this message

No time makes the system go into suspend after 5 seconds.
Any number makes the process wait until that time passed.
-h or --help displayes the usage above.
Anything else will tell you to put in a number.
